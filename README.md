# Safe Exam Browser for Linux

Hey there! This is a community-driven, native Linux version of
Safe Exam Browser. We built it with Qt 6 to give Linux users
a reliable way to take exams without needing a specific OS.

## What is this?

We're trying to make SEB work great on Linux. This client handles all
the important stuff like `.seb` files and special links (`seb://`, `sebs://`),
so you can just focus on your exam.

### Running Everywhere

Safe Exam Browser has options for QtWebEngine and WebKitGTK.
We've also packaged all of the dependencies inside AppImage files so
Safe Exam Browser for Linux really can run anywhere.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> RISC-V or ARM AppImages are not (yet) available.
> Feel free to build them yourself or contribute to the
> building workflow.

You'll need the usual Qt 6 development tools. If you're on something like RISC-V
where Qt WebEngine isn't around, make sure you've got `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`
and `libgtk-3-dev` installed so we can use the fallback engine.

### How to Build

Note: This is for binary builds, for AppImage builds you can use
prebuilt images or utilize `./scripts/build-release.sh`, the dependencies should
be installed automatically on debian systems. It is recommended to build inside
of a debian system or a debian container.

For binary builds, it's pretty simple:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

You'll find the binary at `build/bin/safe-exam-browser`.

### Running an Exam

Just point it at your `.seb` file:

```bash
./safe-exam-browser-qt-x86_64.AppImage /path/to/my-exam.seb
```

Or use a link:

```bash
./safe-exam-browser-qt-x86_64.AppImage sebs://exam-link.seb
```

## Troubleshooting & Support

If you run the app and see a message saying
**"Safe Exam Browser is not supported on your device"**,
it means we couldn't find a compatible browser engine on your system.

We want to fix that!
Please [open an issue here](https://github.com/Jvr2022/seb-linux/issues)
with some details about your system and what version of Linux you're using.

## Known issues

### Unable to spawn a new child process: Failed to spawn child process “/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/webkit2gtk-4.1/WebKitNetworkProcess”

It is impossible for WebKitGTK-dependent packages to utilize the libraries from
inside the AppImage, hence you have to have webkit2gtk-4.1 installed,
and as far as I can tell it only works with debian systems.

The workarounds are:

- Using the QT build.
- Installing the package.
- Running a debian container.

Although we can't seem to fix this, we might provide other backends
as an alternative or there may be a fix in the future.
